# Online retail data analysis
The purpose of the analysis is to extract insights with business value for a webshop selling all-occasion gifts using [R](https://www.r-project.org/), [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/), [sparklyr](https://spark.rstudio.com/), and [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/).

A large part of the analysis consists of data cleaning and basic exploratory analysis, as usually is the case with data science projects. After those basic steps, I employ machine learning algorithms on Spark to uncover more complex customer behavior patterns, like which products are frequently purchased together.

Project deliverables are publicly available [data science notebook](http://rpubs.com/reneeahel/OnlineRetailAnalysisDemo) and an interactive [web application](https://renee-ahel.shinyapps.io/OnlineRetailDemo/), aimed at bringing the project results quickly to the business users.

Due to using Spark, this project can be set up on Linux machines only.
